### Thesis
BEKE is a leading integrated online and offline platform for housing transactions and services in China. In 2023, when China was struggling in its recovery from the impact of COVID-19, BEKE achieved a 65% ROIC, showing its competitive advantage. With prevailing pessimism surrounding the Chinese economy, particularly its real estate sector, there are hidden gems in housing service industry. In the past few months, BEKE have been trading around 9~15x EV/UFCF --- a bargain price for a great company.  I use RMB throughout this writing unless stated otherwise.

### History and Business
BEKE's founder once said "BEKE is 18 years of Lianjia + 2 years of Beike". To fully grasp BEKE's business model, it is essential to comprehend China's local market history and how BEKE evolved from a local realtor shop two decades ago to China's largest housing transaction platform, with a GTV of 3200T. For readers pressed for time, feel free to skip this section and revisit it later for background information if necessary.

In 2001, when Lianjia launched in Beijing, China's house market was chaotic due to a lack of regulation. Websites like Kjj were filled with fake listings to lure customers. Realtors frequently raise asking prices covertly and sabotage each other's deals. The list goes on. These issues, along with failed attempts to enforce transparent transactions, led to Lianjia's agents leaving in 2004, prompting the company to reform at a fundamental level. 

To combat fake listings and create a reliable industry database, Lianjia started developing its "housing dictionary" in 2008. They established a dedicated team to verify landlord identities and property paperworks and conduct detailed physical property inspections. Additionally, they systematically surveyed buildings to determine the number of units in each city. (a bit of context: in China, most people reside in a condo in a 30-floor building. Just in Beijing there are 7 million such condos. Public trading of properties was only allowed after 1998, thus properties with missing registration or title certifications are not uncommon at that time.) Essentially, Lianjia undertook the task of building the Chinese MLS. After 10 years of efforts and investment of 5 billion RMB, the dictionary now encompasses 2 billion authentic properties across 326 cities. Each entry includes meticulous details with 500 data fields. Allegedly it is more accurate and complete than the database of the National Bureau of Statistics.

Meanwhile, as Lianjian expanded, it began testing the Agent Collaboration Network (AGN) concept to forster collabration between agents. AGN standardizes agent collaboration by breaking down complex home sales/rental transactions into standard steps. Agents, even from different branches, can collaborate, each handling one or more steps. Lianjian's algorithm automatically distributes commissions based on everyone's contribution. With system and data set up, Lianjia also needed people who can share its values. To achieve this, they prioritize hiring recent college graduates and train them in-house. Today, 50% of BEKE's agents possess college degrees or higher.

In 2018, Lianjia became the largest brokerage brand in China, boasting 6000 offices and 120,000 agents. Staying true to its mission of reinventing the industry, Lianjia launched the Beike platform and made its "housing dictionary" and AGN available to all brokerage brands willing to join. Additionally, customers can browse listings and agent profiles for free on Beike's app.

This is the Ke Holding we know today. As of 2023, BEKE generates 77B in revenue, sourced from commissions under its Lianjia brand and platform fees from 268 brokerage brands on Beike. 40% of its revenue comes from existing home services, including home sales and rentals. 47% stems from new home transactions, where BEKE acts as a sales channel for real estate developers. The other two income streams, home renovation and emerging services, are relatively small but growing fast.

### Competitive Advantages

|(Billion RMB)|2022|2023|(Billion RMB)|2023
|:---|:----|:-----|:----|---|
|Operating assets (net cash)| 15.5 | 15.8|           Operating income| 4.8|
|Operating liabilities (net debt) | (27.6) | (29.8)| Depreciation & Amortization|1.5|
|**Net working capital**| (12) | (14) |             Income tax (25%)|  (1.8)
|Property, plant and equipment| 2 | 1.9 |           Stock-based compensation (tax adjusted) (0.8)
|Right-of-use assets| 11.3 | 17.6|                 **Net operating profit after tax**| 3.9|
|Intangible assets| 11.3 | 17.6|
|Other non-current assets| 1 | 1.5|
|**Invested capital**| 3.9 | 8|


In 2023, BEKE generated 4.7B NOPAT (excluding SBC) by using 6B average invested capital. ROIC of 65% indicates a strong moat around BEKE's business. In this section, I'll delve into BEKE's competitive strengths and provide two pieces of evidence at the end.

(1) BEKE distinguishes itself as an integrated online and offline platform. Unlike typical e-commerce platforms, such as Alibaba or Amazon, that facilitate direct transactions between sellers and consumers, BEKE provides a platform for realtors in serving both sellers and buyers in the market. This distinction arises from the unique nature of the real estate industry, where residential properties are not click-and-buy products. Each property is unique in terms of location, condition, and other factors, requiring local insights and professional knowledge of realtors. Additionally, the significant financial investment and complex paperworks involved further underscores the need for personalized service. Therefore, digital solutions cannot fully replace the offline aspects of the process, making the agent network indispensable in housing transactions and services. This deters those e-commerce giants from breaking into the housing industry.

(2) The ACN and authentic housing data are two pillars of BEKE's competitive advantage. The ACN fosters collaboration between brokerage brands and agents, standardizing and streamlining the transaction process to improve service efficiency and quality. Its "housing dictionary" database and the associated SaaS service serve as the backbone for the ACN operation. Their seamless integration improves service quality and builds brand name, empowering the network effect (Fig.1) and forms an impenetrable barrier for its peer competitors.

(3) The 3100 TB database compiled by BEKE, developed over billions of RMB and decades of effort, is invaluable by itself. It provides exclusive insights into industrial trends and consumer behaviors, enabling better matching between buyers and sellers, strategy optimization, and the growth of new business.

(4) In 2020, Alibaba and Yiju, a real estate service company, formed a joint venture to sell new properties online. The idea was to leverage Alibaba's vast online traffic and huge discount offerings. As I pointed out, traditional e-commerce strategies won't work because residential property is not a click-and-buy product. Just one year later, Alibaba exited the venture by selling 85% of its share to Yiju. Yiju defaulted on its debts in 2022.

(5) Since 2021, BEKE has operated with negative working capital. As current liabilities rose with revenue recovery, current assets slightly decreased. Fig.2 shows the trends of BEKE's revenue, receivables and contract liabilities for different segments in the past 5 years. When real estate developers faced liquidity issues, BEKE implemented various risk-control measures, including upfront commission payments from developers before sales. As a result, receivables from new home transaction services, comprising over 95% of BEKE’s total receivables, decreased by 74% since 2020. Meanwhile, its contract liabilities tripled. This prudent management contrasts with Yiju's bankruptcy due to developers' insolvency. Moreover, BEKE's ability to implement the "commission in advance" model underscores its strong bargaining power, a hallmark of businesses with competitive advantages. A similar trend is observed in BEKE’s home renovation and emerging services, where customers are required to pay (partially) in advance. As depicted in Fig. 2, contract liabilities for both segments increased significantly faster than receivables.

### Growth

A great company generates high return on invested capital and has sustainable room for growth and compounding. I've already discussed BEKE's ability to generate high returns; now, let's look into its growth prospects.

(1) Before COVID-19, BEKE experienced annual revenue growth of 30%. However, the strict lockdown measures significantly affected its operations as offline work is essential for agents. Despite this, the pandemic's impact is waning. The rapid recovery of the existing house segment and the growth of renovation and emerging services, as indicated in Fig.2, demonstrate this. In fact, BEKE's overall revenue has already recovered to 90% of its 2021 level.

(2) The lag in the new home segment is linked to the recent turmoil of China’s real estate market, a result of a decade-long overheated market and high leverage among major developers. However, this downturn has a lesser impact on BEKE’s existing home segment. The rental market in China's major cities, where BEKE has a significant market share, is supported by demand of foreign workers. With the highest gross margin of 47.2%, compared to 26.6% in the new home segment, the impact is further reduced on the bottom line.  Finally, the rapid growth of emerging services like renovations and property management will provide further diversification in the future.

(3) BEKE still has ample room to expand its market share by leveraging its network effects. The realtor industry remains highly fragmented, with BEKE currently holding a market share of 9.7%, while the nearest competitor only has 1.4%.

(4) In the long term, people are increasingly viewing properties as places to live rather than for speculation. This shift presents new opportunities for growth in the housing service industry. BEKE, with its extensive data on housing consumers, is well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities. For example, in 2021, BEKE launched home renovation and furnishing services, allowing users to customize and preview designs in the app using VR technology. Revenue from this segment grew from 197 million to 10 billion in three years, making it BEKE's third-largest business. Interestingly, the home decor and renovation industry in China right now is highly fragmented and lacks standardization, resembling the realtor business 20 years ago. BEKE is aiming to replicate its past success. Just a lot faster this time.

### Valuation

|(Billion RMB)|2023|(Billion RMB) | 2023|
|:---|:----|:---------|:----|
|Market cap| 103--130| NOPAT| 3.9|
|Debt (with lease liability)| 18| Capex (3y average) | (1.0)
|Cash & Investment| (77) | Change in working capital | 1.8|
|**Enterprise value**| 44--71| **UFCF**| 4.7|

Many investors tend to shy away from Chinese companies for many reasons that I won't repeat here, perhaps with the real estate sector being particularly unpopular right now. However, BEKE's business differs significantly from that of highly leveraged real estate developers. The realtor business is light on assets and lucrative. BEKE holds a robust balance sheet with 77 billion in cash and investments and only 41M short-term debt. (Although I include lease liability in my calculation of EV for consistency, I do not think that leasing liabilities are real debts).

As a value investor, I restrain myself from dwelling too much on political risks or macroeconomic projections. Throughout history, economic downturns, bear markets, and sectors with widespread pessimism have often presented great opportunities to discover undervalued assets. At time of this writing, BEKE's stock price is fluctuating between 12-15 USD/share, with an EV/UFCF ratio ranging from 9-15x. This is a low valuation for a solid business with franchise value and ample room for growth.

### Catalyst
BEKE has spent 1.1 billion USD for share buybacks since 2022. Until March 2024, approximately 870 million USD remains available under its share repurchase program. If completed I expect in total around 10% of its shares, or 18% of free float, will be canceled. Insiders owns 42% of its outstanding shares, and Tencent (pre-IPO investor) holds a stake of 11.4%.
